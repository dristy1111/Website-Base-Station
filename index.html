      <h1>What is Power BI</h1>
      <p>
        Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that
        work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent,
        visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data might be an
        Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid
        data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources,
        visualize and discover what’s important, and share that with anyone or
        everyone you want.
      </p>

        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>Why Power BI?</h3>
          <p>
            Power BI is a common business intelligence tool used by business
            analysts and professionals. It is designed to be easily accessible
            for those without any specialized data knowledge. It is used for
            creating reports and dashboards that present data sets in multiple
            ways using visuals, connecting various data sources, such as Excel
            sheets, onsite data warehouses, and cloud-based data storage, and
            then transforming them into business insights.
          </p>

        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>ADVANTAGES OF POWER BI</h3>
          <p>
            Affordability: Power BI is relatively inexpensive compared to other
            BI tools in the market. It also offers a free version with limited
            capabilities. Custom Visualizations: Power BI allows users to create
            custom visualizations and reports according to their needs. Excel
            Integration: Power BI integrates seamlessly with Excel, allowing
            users to import data and create reports using familiar tools.
          </p>
          <div class="course-col">
            <h3>DISADVANTAGES OF POWER BI</h3>
            <p>
              Cost: While Power BI is affordable, the cost can add up for larger
              organizations as each user requires a license. Steep Learning
              Curve: Power BI can be complex and difficult to learn for
              beginners. Limited Customization: Although Power BI allows for
              custom visualizations, it has limitations and may not be as
              flexible as some other BI tools.
