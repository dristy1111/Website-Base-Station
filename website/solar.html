            <ul>
                <li>Utilizing renewable energy is an efficient approach for creating eco-friendly systems.</li>
                <li>Various renewable energy processes include solar systems, biomass energy, and wind power.</li>
                <li>Solar panels harness energy from sunlight, while wind turbines utilize wind power, and biomass systems convert waste into energy.</li>
                <li>Our strategy involves a hybrid system of solar panels and wind power for generating electricity at base stations.</li>
                <li>Sufficient solar panels and wind turbines ensure ample electricity production for base stations.</li>
                <li>Solar panels store excess energy in battery banks for use during nighttime or grid disconnection, while wind power remains available day and night.</li>
                <li>Excess energy generated during base station sleep mode can also be stored for future use.</li>
                <li>We opt to avoid diesel generators due to high carbon emissions and cost, aiming to minimize environmental impact.</li>
                <li>Diesel generators consume 0.44 liters per kWh and emit 2.68 kg of carbon dioxide per liter.</li>
                <li>By using renewable energy, we strive to ensure reliable power supply while reducing environmental harm.</li>
