    <h1 class="colorful-text">GitHub Disadvantages</h1>
    <p>GitHub is a web-based interface allowing real-time collaboration. It encourages teams to work together in developing code,
       building web pages, and updating content. Read on for a quick introduction to GitHub.</p>
    <div style="font-size: 150%; font-family: Courier; line-height: 100%;">

        While GitHub is a powerful tool for version control and collaboration, it has some disadvantages:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> GitHub can be complex for beginners, requiring a learning curve to understand Git commands and workflows.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Private repositories on GitHub are not free, which might be a limitation for individuals or small teams with limited budgets.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliance on Internet:</strong> GitHub requires an internet connection to access repositories and perform many tasks, which can be a limitation in areas with poor connectivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Concerns:</strong> Public repositories are visible to everyone, which can lead to potential security risks if sensitive information is accidentally committed.</li>
            <li><strong>Limited Storage:</strong> GitHub imposes storage limits on repositories, which can be restrictive for projects with large files or extensive histories.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependency on Git:</strong> Users must be familiar with Git commands and concepts, which adds an additional layer of complexity for those new to version control systems.</li>
        </ul>
        Despite these disadvantages, GitHub remains a widely used and valuable tool for developers worldwide.
