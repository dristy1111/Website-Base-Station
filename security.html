      <h1>Power BI Security and Governance</h1>
      <p>
        Power BI, Microsoft’s leading business intelligence platform, offers
        robust security and governance features to protect your data and empower
        users with controlled access. Power BI security refers to a set of
        processes, policies, and standards that organisations put in place to
        manage and control the use of Power BI. Governance is critical to ensure
        that the use of Power BI is aligned with the organisation’s objectives
        and strategy, complies with relevant regulations and standards, and
        protects sensitive data.

          <h3>Security Features</h3>
          <p>
            Power BI's security features include row- and column-level security,
            cloud access security, information protection, and unified endpoint
            management. Understanding user roles, permissions, authentication,
            and data encryption as well as harnessing these controls will
            fortify your Power BI environment against potential threats.

          <h3>Governance Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            When considering data governance in any organization, the best place
            to start is by defining a governance strategy. By focusing first on
            the strategic goals for data governance, all detailed decisions when
            implementing governance policies and processes can be informed by
            the strategy.

      <h1>Security Best Practices</h1>
      <p>
        Implementing best practices for Power BI security is crucial to protect
        your data and ensure compliance. These practices include setting up
        row-level security, using secure embed codes, and regularly auditing and
        monitoring Power BI usage.

            <h3>Row-Level Security</h3>
            <p>
              Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI allows you to restrict data
              access at the row level based on user roles. It is a crucial
              feature for organizations that need to secure data based on the
              user's role or team.

            <h3>Secure Embed Codes</h3>
            <p>
              Secure embed codes provide a way to share Power BI reports and
              dashboards securely. They are a simple and effective way to share
              insights while maintaining control over who can see the data.
